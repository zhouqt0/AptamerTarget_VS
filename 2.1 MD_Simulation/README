In this section, we performed restrain-free MD simulation to that allowing the initially assumed binding conformations to evolve dynamically to account for the molecular recognition processes between aptamer and target. The docking poses of primary candidates in complex with LABA was placed in a cubic box, which extended at least 10 Å between the complex and the boundary of the box. To neutralize the simulated system, sodium and chloride ions were added to reach concentration of approximately 150 mM. 
Run-MD-50ns.sh is the executable script, please revise parameters accordingly.
