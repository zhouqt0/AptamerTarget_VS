In this section, we performed Prime MM-GBSA calculation that computed the force field energies in implicit solvent of the bound and unbound molecules involved in the binding process, where all bases within 6 Å of the docked compounds were relaxed using VSGB2.0 implicit solvent model with the OPLS3 force field

******************************************************
There are five fundamental energy calculations done in Prime MM-GBSA:
Optimized free receptor (="Receptor")
Optimized free ligand (="Ligand")
Optimized complex (="Complex")
Receptor from minimized/optimized complex
Ligand from minimized/optimized complex
From these energies, the following strain and binding energies are calculated:
Rec Strain = Receptor(from optimized complex) − Receptor
Lig Strain = Ligand(from optimized complex) − Ligand
MMGBSA dG Bind = Complex − Receptor − Ligand
MMGBSA dG Bind(NS) = Complex − Receptor(from optimized complex) − Ligand(from optimized complex) = MMGBSA dG Bind − Rec Strain − Lig Strain
In the last energy above, "NS" means "no strain"; it is the binding/interaction energy without accounting for the receptor and ligand conformational changes needed to form the complex. The energies of the ligand and receptor from the minimized/optimized complex are not reported as output properties. However, they can be calculated from the other properties that are reported, if desired. Also, the "Rec Strain" properties are not reported if Prime MM-GBSA is run without receptor flexibility.

In addition to the total energy, the contributions to the total energy from different components is reported. The components are listed below:
Coulomb—Coulomb energy
Covalent—Covalent binding energy
vdW—Van der Waals energy
Lipo—Lipophilic energy
Solv GB—Generalized Born electrostatic solvation energy
Energy—Total energy (Prime energy)
Hbond—Hydrogen-bonding correction
Packing—Pi-pi packing correction
SelfCont—Self-contact correction
