# AptamerTarget_VS
The computational screening of promiscuous binders for an aptamer consisted of two stages: 

(1) High-throughput virtual screening, which consisted of molecular docking and conformational relaxation to identify the primary candidates of aptamer;

(2) Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation-based binding affinity prediction, where unrestrained MD simulations of the docked aptamer-target complex were performed to mimic the dynamic molecular recognition processes; then, the extracted snapshots of the aptamer-target complex from MD simulation trajectories were subjected to molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) and normal-mode analysis (NMA) calculations.

Here, we selected L-argininamide (L-Arm) binding aptamer (LABA) as an example to present all computational details and related scripts.
